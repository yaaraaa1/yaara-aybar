    <p>Older adults today face a myriad of problems, from financial difficulty to extreme health conditions. Many of these issues stem from young adult life decisions, such as failure to save for retirement or unhealthy lifestyle choices. Previous research suggests that intertemporal choices like these can be traced back to the concept of future self-continuity. Increased connection to one’s future self has been linked to more exercise (Rutchick et al., 2018) and more ethical behavior (Hershfield et al., 2012). Hershfield et al., 2014 found that viewing age-progressed renderings of oneself increased retirement-saving behavior through efforts to increase future self-continuity. Fox & Bailenson, 2009 concluded that viewing a virtual progression of oneself transforming in weight was more effective in changing exercise habits than viewing a static outcome. Based on this research, the current study tested the effects of viewing a static, aged image or a dynamic, aged progression video of oneself on intertemporal decision-making, using a modern, advanced age-transformation model. We hypothesized that participants would make long-term choices more beneficial to their older self when viewing a progression than when viewing a static image of their older self. We also predicted that the groups viewing their future selves would engage in less temporal discounting and make better long-term decisions than those in the control group (viewing their current selves). No significant correlations were found, and differences in temporal discounting and future self-continuity between the conditions were minimal. We suggest that further research is needed to shed light on the extent of future self-continuity’s role in intertemporal choices, as well as the potential benefits of dynamic progressions versus static images.</p>
