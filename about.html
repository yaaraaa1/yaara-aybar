                <p>I am a recent graduate of Yale University with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and an Advanced Language Certificate in Hebrew. My chosen focus within the Cognitive Science major was Human-Computer Interaction, which examines novel ways to understand machines within the framework of human intelligence, to build user-centered interfaces, and to explore machine learning applications for societal improvement.</p>
                <p>Throughout my time at Yale, I held several leadership positions, including Elected Senator in the Yale College Council, VP of Standards and Academic Excellence in Kappa Kappa Gamma, and President of Yale Friends of Israel. Outside of campus, I spent two summers interning at Microsoft, deepening my knowledge of Azure Data (cloud software), Surface (devices), and program management work as a whole.</p>
                <p>I look forward to future opportunities for creative problem-solving, outside-the-box thinking, engagement in challenging new projects, and dynamic team collaboration.</p>
