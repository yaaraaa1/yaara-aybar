                <p>I am a recent graduate of Yale University with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and an Advanced Language Certificate in Hebrew. My chosen focus within the Cognitive Science major was Human-Computer Interaction, which examines novel ways to understand machines within the framework of human intelligence, to build user-centered interfaces, and to explore machine learning applications for societal improvement.</p>
                <p>Throughout my time on campus, I held several leadership positions, including Elected Senator in the Yale College Council, VP of Standards and Academic Excellence in Kappa Kappa Gamma, and President of Yale Friends of Israel. </p>
                <p>Outside of Yale, my favorite hobbies are painting, cycling, and solving mysteries--from escape rooms to cryptograms to reading murder mystery novels. I love finding challenging new projects to work on and opportunities to channel my creativity. I also love my dog Toffee, an adorable Norfolk Terrier currently residing in Las Vegas.</p>

            <p>For two summers, I had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft in Azure Data and Surface Devices.
                Below are some of the projects I worked on last summer in the Surface SW SI PM team. I'm excited to continue contributing to other awesome projects when I return to Surface full-time this fall!</p>
